<p>Since 1983, the Life Sciences Research Foundation (LSRF) has funded nearly
500 outstanding postdoctoral fellows in all areas of the life sciences,
including 57 in plant biology. We believe that discoveries and application
of innovations in biology for the public's good depends upon the training
and support of the highest quality young scientists. Every year a selection
committee representing a broad range of sub-disciplines within biology
identify the top 5% of applicants from an international pool of more than
1000 postdoctoral applicants. Once chosen, the LSRF collaborates with
current and potential sponsors to match them with fellows with similar
research interests. In 2013, thirty-two of these remarkable young
scientists were matched with sponsors to support their research. Yet even
now many excellent scientists remain unfunded.</p>

<p>Plant biologists interesting in a postdoctoral fellowship should consult
the Life Sciences Research Foundation website (<a href="http://www.lsrf.org/">http://www.lsrf.org/</a>) for
information about how to apply. The next deadline for applications will be
October 1, 2014.</p>
