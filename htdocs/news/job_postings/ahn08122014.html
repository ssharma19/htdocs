<p>Two postdoctoral researcher positions are available starting 
immediately to study ambient temperature-responsive flowering and 
biochemistry of floral integrator proteins in Arabidopsis at Korea 
University, Seoul, Korea. These are full-time grant-funded positions 
(Creative Research Initiative in Korea). </p>

<p>The project will use biochemistry of the SVP and FLM proteins and FT protein binding to phospholipid. A strong background on protein degradation (e.g. ubiquitination and sumoylation) or phospholipid analysis is highly advantageous. Applicants who have received their PhD degrees within the past three years strongly preferred. Successful applicants will be expected to show a high degree of research productivity, good communication skills (both oral and written), and an 
ability to work collaboratively with other lab members. Starting salary will be commensurate with previous experience of the applicant. </p>
