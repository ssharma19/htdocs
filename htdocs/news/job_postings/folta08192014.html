<p>Greetings Arabdiopsis Fans, <br /> <br />

There is a position opening in my lab. It is for a non-tenure-track 
Research Professor position. The incumbent will serve as a central 
resource for all research activities underway in the lab, and he/she will 
be encouraged to drive his/her own research program as desired. The 
incumbent will participate in preparation of grants and manuscripts. </p>

<p>We work on a wide range of projects. Our central interest is using 
genomics and computational tools to match genes to the biology they 
control. The work is primarily done in strawberry, which affords many 
excellent tools for investigating key processes in the valuable Rosaceae 
family. We currently are advancing a project in Arabidopsis that is 
extremely exciting and has potential to make significant impacts. </p>

<p>Should you apply? <br /><br />


* A competitive candidate must have a strong classical training in 
molecular biology, plant physiology and genomics. <br /><br />


* Desirable additional skills include tissue culture, plant 
transformation, RNAseq, Arabidopsis transformation, <br /><br />


* All candidates must be willing to assist graduate students and 
postdocs and work collaboratively with other faculty here at UF. <br /><br />



* Strong written and oral communication skills are required. 
Samples of written work will be requested. <br /><br />


<p>Limitations: The salary associated with the position is low compared to 
that in industry, etc. However, the security is good and the work 
environment and scientific freedom are excellent. You also will be able to 
supplement funding from grants. </p>

<p>Strengths: Gainesville is an affordable place to live and a wonderful 
place to spend a career. Our lab is a diverse blend of projects and 
personalities, and much of our work directly impacts the state's 
agricultural industries. </p>
